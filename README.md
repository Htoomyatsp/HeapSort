# HeapSort
Implementation using Heap Sort. This repository contains two Java implementations of the HeapSort algorithm, demonstrating different approaches to sorting arrays using a binary heap. The HeapSort algorithm is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), and it is widely used for its performance and in-place sorting capabilities.

The repository includes two variants of the HeapSort implementation:

HeapSort (with Timing and Random Input): This version sorts arrays of different sizes, generating random elements for each array and measuring the CPU time taken for the sorting process.
HeapSort2 (Multiple Input Arrays): A more straightforward implementation of HeapSort that sorts predefined input arrays, displaying both the original and sorted arrays.
